<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully bootstrapped a comprehensive CRM application using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The trajectory shows a systematic build process, starting with core authentication (Google OAuth) and essential CRM entities (Contacts, Accounts, Products, Invoices, Calendar). A significant portion of the work involved iterative UI/UX refinements, including branding, navigation reordering, text centering, and implementing professional list views for all entities. A key challenge was the logo integration due to placeholder files, which was eventually resolved by creating a temporary text logo and then integrating the actual provided logo. The system was extensively tested at various stages, achieving a perfect score. The latest efforts involve transitioning the MVP into a SaaS platform by adding a pricing page with Stripe integration and an administrative backend. The AI engineer has consistently followed user requests, clarified ambiguities, and provided detailed updates and test reports.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a comprehensive CRM application with invoicing functionality linked to Peppol, specifically for Belgium businesses. Initial requirements included Google OAuth authentication, core CRM entities: Dashboard, Contacts, Accounts, Products, Invoices, and Calendar. The application needed a professional, responsive UI with advanced Tailwind patterns. Later, specific enhancements were requested: changing the app name to yourocrm.com, prioritizing the Calendar in navigation, building full Calendar functionality, adding a left sidebar ribbon with all entities, integrating a user-provided logo, adding a global search, quick action plus buttons for record creation, and making the logo more responsive. Most recently, the user requested a pricing page with Stripe payment integration for full access at 14.99€ and an administrative backend for user/field/template management.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core of the FastAPI backend. It handles API routes for authentication (Google OAuth), CRM entities (Contacts, Accounts, Products, Invoices, Calendar events), and now payment processing (Stripe). It includes MongoDB connection setup, CORS handling, Pydantic models for data validation, and PDF generation logic using . It's critical for all data storage and retrieval.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: This is the main React component. It defines the application's overall structure, including routing for different CRM sections (Dashboard, Contacts, Accounts, Products, Invoices, Calendar, Pricing, Admin), the sidebar navigation, and handles state management for user authentication and UI elements like modals.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**: This file contains global CSS rules and Tailwind CSS directives. It's used for styling the overall layout, responsive behaviors, and specific UI components. It was modified extensively for logo styling, sidebar layout, text centering, and general aesthetic improvements.
-   **/app/frontend/public/index.html**: The entry point for the frontend application. It was updated to include YouroCRM branding in the title and meta tags, and to reference the favicon.
-   **/app/frontend/public/image.png**: The actual YouroCRM logo image file, uploaded by the user and integrated into the application for branding.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.  and  were added during development.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**: Manages Node.js dependencies for the React frontend.  was added for HTTP requests.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement the Admin backend for user management, custom fields, and template modification.
- Ensure complete integration and testing of the Stripe payment flow on the pricing page.
- Further enhance the login page design as offered when discussing Google OAuth branding.
- Create privacy policy and terms of service pages.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was actively working on transforming the YouroCRM into a SaaS platform. Specifically, the work immediately preceding this summary involved:

1.  **Implementing the Pricing Page**: The AI engineer had just finished adding the  component to the frontend (frontend/src/components/PricingPage.js) and integrating its route into . This page is designed to offer full access for 14.99€ with online payment.
2.  **Integrating Stripe for Payments**: The  was used to get the Stripe playbook. Subsequently,  and  dependencies were added to  and installed. Backend models for payments (, , ) and corresponding API routes (, ) were added to .
3.  **Initiating Admin Panel Development**: The  component was created in the frontend (frontend/src/components/AdminPanel.js). The very last action was to add the Admin route to the main  file, setting up the path for the administration interface.

The application now has a basic frontend structure for a pricing page and an admin panel, with the backend ready to handle Stripe payment intents and webhooks, although the full end-to-end payment and admin functionality is not yet complete or tested.
